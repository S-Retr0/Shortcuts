# Shortcuts

This is a list of useful shortcuts to improve my workflow.

# MacOS
To use a keyboard shortcut, press and hold one or more modifier keys and then press the last key of the shortcut. For example, to use ⌘-C (copy), press and hold the ⌘ key, then the C key, then release both keys. Mac menus and keyboards often use [symbols for certain keys](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/what-are-those-symbols-shown-in-menus-cpmh0011), including modifier keys:

 - Command (or Cmd) ⌘
 - Option (or Alt) ⌥
 - Caps Lock ⇪
 - Shift ⇧
 - Control (or Ctrl) ⌃
 - Fn

###### *On keyboards made for Windows PCs, use the Alt key instead of ⌥, and the Windows logo key instead of ⌘.*
